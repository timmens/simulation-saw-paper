# TODO

Notes on what remains to be done for the simulation part of the paper and on errors that
I encountered. For PDF manuscript version with annotations click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cMP0wbfQ5MLAQJbb1cjegLYZyIHuYMtS/view?usp=sharing).


Notes on the mathematical formulation of the new DGPs is found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pEXFkq0QZZ7aXemwTQq7LWjxgb7NS6aL/view?usp=sharing).


## todo list

- [ ] 5. R1: Setup DGP with time fixed effects.
- [ ] 5. R3: Simulation results n = 30. Might need to focus on SAW-estimator and compare quantity defined in Thm 1.
- [ ] 6. R3: DGP with endogeneous regressors, maybe delete DGP2 or DGP3 (Dominik favors deleting DGP3). Need to check if MATLAB codes can handle this case and if yes udpate code there to.


## errors / questions


1. Error variance in paper and simulation are not the same
2. Matlab used different number of observations than R, or do I have an old version of the matlab codes?
